# Pet Shop Management System

## Overview

This Java program simulates a Pet Shop Management System where the user can record and display pet information. The program follows an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, utilizing Java to create a menu-driven system. The recorded pet information varies based on user preferences and includes details such as pet name, type (Dog or Cat), breed, color, age, sex, and owner's name.

## Pet Information Possibilities

1. Pet name and type (Dog or Cat)
2. Pet name, type (Dog or Cat), and breed
3. Pet name, type (Dog or Cat), breed, and color
4. Pet name, type (Dog or Cat), breed, color, and age
5. Pet name, type (Dog or Cat), breed, color, age, and sex
6. Pet name, type (Dog or Cat), breed, color, age, sex, and ownerâ€™s name

## Program Structure

The program is structured with a class named `Pet` that includes overloaded constructors to create `Pet` objects based on the user's choice among the given possibilities. The `ShowDetails()` method is used to display the details of each pet. The main execution of the program is handled in a separate class named `Main.java`.

## How to Run

To test the program, execute the `Main.java` class, which contains the main method. The program will present a menu for encoding pet information, and it will continue until the user selects the EXIT option.
